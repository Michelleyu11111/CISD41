Create the remote repo on GitHub

Go to GitHub, click "New", and create an empty repository.

Do not initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license.

Copy the remote repo URL. For example:

git@github.com:Michelleyu11111/CISD41.git
Using Git in the Command Prompt

Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder:


cd C:\Users\ivyyu\DataScienceDISD41\Project
Initialize the Git repository:

git init
Add the remote URL of your GitHub repo:


git remote add origin git@github.com:Michelleyu11111/CISD41.git
Add and commit your files:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Push to GitHub:

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


 Notes
If youâ€™re using the git@github.com:... format (SSH), make sure your SSH keys are set up on your computer and added to your GitHub account.

If you're not using SSH, you can replace the URL with the HTTPS version instead:

https://github.com/Michelleyu11111/CISD41.git
